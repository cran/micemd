\title{
Imputation by a two-level heteroscedastic normal model based on a two-stage estimator
}
\description{
Imputes univariate two-level continuous variable from a heteroscedastic normal model. The imputation method is based on a two-stage estimator: at step 1, a linear regression model is fitted to each observed cluster; at step 2, estimates obtained from each cluster are combined according to a linear random effect model.

\arguments{
\item{y}{
Incomplete data vector of length \code{n}
}
  \item{ry}{
Vector of missing data pattern \code{(FALSE=missing, TRUE=observed)}
}
  \item{x}{
Matrix \code{(n x p)} of complete covariates.
}
  \item{type}{
Vector of length \code{ncol(x)} identifying random and class variables. Random variables are identified by a '2'. The class variable (only one is allowed) is coded as '-2'. Random variables also include the fixed effect.
}
  \item{method_est}{
Vector of string given the version of the estimator to used. Choose \code{method_est="reml"} for restricted maximum likelihood estimator or \code{method_est="mm"} for the method of moments. By default \code{method_est="mm"}.

\details{
Imputes univariate two-level continuous variable from a heteroscedastic normal model. The imputation method is based on a two-stage estimator: at step 1, a linear regression model is fitted to each observed cluster; at step 2, estimates obtained from each cluster are combined according to a linear random effect model. Two possibilities are available to combine estimates at stage 2: by default, parameters of the linear random effect model are estimated according to the method of moments (MM), otherwise, parameters of the linear random effect model can be estimated according to the restricted maximum likelihood estimator (REML). The variability on the parameters of the imputation is propagated according to an asymptotic strategy requiring a large number of clusters. Compared to the REML version, the MM version is quicker to perform, but it provides less theoretical garanties. Nevertheless, simulation studies show that both versions lead to similar inferences (Resche-Rigon, M. and White, I. R. (2016)).
